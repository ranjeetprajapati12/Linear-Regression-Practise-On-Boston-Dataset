# Linear-Regression-Practice-On-Boston-Dataset
In this file I have done some basic Exploratory Data Analisys first . And second I m predicting the output from input dataset by using Machine Learning Algorithm. 
I m using Linear Regression  cost fuction for prediction of output result  . And after that I'm using Ridge ,Lasso and Elastic Net for more acurate result.

For Machine Learning Alorithm Im using sklearn module from scikit for different operation.
